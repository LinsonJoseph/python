# python
Please find here a repository of programs that I create as I am learning the language. I am putting an effort to document and describe what I am trying out in each code that I publish. Hope you enjoy learning with me.


Installing external libraries on a windows system:
While coding python programs you may sometimes need to import functions and classes from external libraries. However, befor you import them you will have to install them on you system. To do this on a windows10 machine open the command prompt. You may type 'cmd' in the search box next to the windows icon (bottom-left). Click the (black) command prompt icon in the search result. You will see a prompt that reads C:\Users\User>. Type pip install <Library_name you want to install>. An example is provide below:
C:\Users\User>pip install numpy


Viewing installed libraries:
There are many pre-installed libraries available when you install Pyhton. To view the list of installed libraries and their versions use the below command in command prompt:
C:\Users\User>pip list
