# python
Please find here a repository of programs that I create as I am learning the language. I am putting an effort to document and describe what I am trying out in each code that I publish. Hope you enjoy learning with me.


Some information that may be handy when working on Python... 

Opening the command prompt in windows:
You may type 'cmd' in the search box next to the windows icon (bottom-left). Click the (black) command prompt icon in the search result. You will see a prompt that reads C:\Users\User>


Installing external libraries on a windows system:
While coding python programs you may sometimes need to import functions and classes from external libraries. However, before you import them you will have to install them on you system. Type pip install <Library_name you want to install> in command prompt. An example is:
C:\Users\User>pip install numpy


Viewing installed libraries:
There are many pre-installed libraries available when you install Pyhton. To view the list of installed libraries and their versions use the below command in command prompt:
C:\Users\User>pip list
